## How to make it work

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

installs all of the dependencies, only the first time hay!

### `npm run all`

Runs the app .<br />
Open [http://localhost:3331](http://localhost:3331) to view it in the browser.


## Configuration

The App is driven by a file located at ```src/config.json``` where you can have as much fun as your tummy can take with the endpoints.





Note: it is only one level deep, don't try break my app or the Lord of the naughty coders will make your fingernails grow 5" overnight.
